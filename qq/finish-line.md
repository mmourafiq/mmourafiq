How to finish work?
What are some common activities to go from 90% to 100%?

* Present the work to other teams.
* Broadcast an email with the takeaways so that the rest of your organization knows about it.
* Put the code somewhere that your coworkers can make use of later.
* Write a blog post about it. Post it on Twitter, HN, and Reddit.
* Sketch out a next-steps document, even if you have no plans to continue, that explains what you
  would do next and why.
* Look for adjacent projects that could benefit.
* Find someone that can poke holes in your work, then go address them.
* Write a test for it.

-> Evangelism, documentation, and polish are often just as important as the core project.
