The purpose of crushed stones alongside railway tracks also known as "ballast" is multi-fold:

1. **Structural Support**: The ballast supports the railway tracks and provides a solid and stable
   bed for the tracks to rest on. This helps to distribute the load of the trains evenly across the
   track structure and underlying ground, reducing the chance of the tracks deforming under the
   heavy loads of passing trains.

2. **Drainage**: The ballast acts as a drainage system for the railway tracks. Water can quickly
   percolate through the stones and away from the tracks, helping to keep the tracks dry and
   reducing the risk of damage and corrosion due to water.

3. **Limit Vegetation**: The crushed stones make it difficult for vegetation to grow, which could
   interfere with track structure or train operation.

4. **Limit Track Movement**: Ballast resists movement of the track, which is particularly important
   when trains pass over, as they exert powerful forces that can displace the rails. By resisting
   these forces, ballast helps to maintain the correct gauge (distance between the tracks) and
   alignment of the track.

5. **Maintenance and Repair**: The ballast allows for easy access for maintenance and repair work.
   If a part of the track needs to be repaired or replaced, workers can simply remove the ballast,
   perform the necessary work, and then replace the ballast.

6. **Noise and Vibration Absorption**: The ballast also plays a role in reducing noise and vibration
   caused by the trains passing over the tracks. The crushed stones can absorb some of the
   vibrations, leading to a quieter and smoother ride.

The use of a hard, durable material beneath the railway tracks to distribute the load and maintain
track stability has been a part of railway construction since the earliest days of the railway. The
concept evolved gradually over the years, as engineers learned more about the challenges of building
and maintaining railway tracks.

In the early days of railways, tracks were laid on a variety of surfaces, including wooden planks
and even just bare earth. However, these surfaces had significant drawbacks. Wooden planks could rot
or warp, and bare earth could be eroded by rain or compressed by the weight of the trains.

The idea of using crushed stone or gravel - what we now call "ballast" - likely came from observing
the natural world. People noticed that large stones remained stable and didn't sink into the earth,
even under heavy loads. This is because the stones distribute the load over a larger area, reducing
the pressure on the underlying ground. This observation likely led to the idea of using crushed
stones beneath the railway tracks.

The first known use of stone ballast is attributed to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a renowned British
civil engineer. He used it for the Great Western Railway in England, which started operation in the
1830s. The results were very positive, and the use of ballast quickly spread.

Over time, the benefits of using ballast became more apparent. Engineers realized that ballast
provided excellent drainage, which helped to prevent water damage to the tracks. They also found
that it made maintenance easier, since the stones could be easily moved aside to allow for repairs.

Today, the use of ballast is standard in railway construction around the world, thanks to its many
benefits in maintaining the stability, durability, and safety of the railway tracks.
