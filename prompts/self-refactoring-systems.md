Building a self-refactoring system involves designing software that can automatically improve its
own codebase by optimizing structure, readability, maintainability, and performance. This type of
system can save time for developers and lead to more efficient and reliable software. To build such
a system, consider the following steps:

1. Define the scope: Determine the goals and requirements of the self-refactoring system. Identify
   the languages and frameworks it should support, and the extent of refactoring it should perform.

2. Develop refactoring rules: Define a set of refactoring rules, patterns, and best practices that
   the system will use to refactor the codebase. These rules should be adaptable to different
   programming languages and coding styles.

3. Implement code analysis: Design a module to analyze the codebase and identify areas for
   improvement. This may include detecting code smells, inefficiencies, and violations of coding
   conventions or best practices.

4. Implement code transformation: Develop a module to automatically apply the refactoring rules and
   transformations to the identified areas of the code. This module should be able to handle complex
   changes and preserve the functionality of the original code.

5. Develop a testing framework: Implement a testing framework to ensure that the refactored code
   maintains the same functionality as the original code. This could involve using unit tests,
   integration tests, and regression tests.

6. Implement continuous integration: Integrate the self-refactoring system into the development
   pipeline, so it runs automatically during the build process, or as a separate step in the
   pipeline.

7. Monitor and evaluate performance: Continuously monitor the performance of the self-refactoring
   system to identify any issues or inefficiencies. This will help you fine-tune the refactoring
   rules and algorithms.

8. User interface and configuration: Provide a user interface for developers to interact with the
   self-refactoring system. Allow them to configure the system according to their project
   requirements and preferences.

9. Update and maintain: Regularly update the system to support new programming languages,
   frameworks, and refactoring rules. Keep up with best practices and industry standards.

10. Documentation and support: Provide clear documentation on how to use the self-refactoring
    system, as well as support resources for troubleshooting and addressing issues.

Building a self-refactoring system is a complex task that requires deep understanding of programming
languages, software development practices, and code analysis techniques. However, with careful
planning and implementation, such a system can greatly improve the efficiency and maintainability of
software projects.
