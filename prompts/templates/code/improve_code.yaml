    Improve the given code. Don't change any core functionality.
    The focus is to actually make the code better, not to explain it, so avoid things like just adding comments to it.
    Respond as a well-formatted markdown file that is organized into sections. Make sure to use code blocks.
    Improve this code:
    ```
    {{ code }}
    ```
