## Prompt

Why using chatGPT feels like protagonist in the movie Memento?

## Response

I can understand why you might feel that way. In the movie "Memento," the protagonist, Leonard
Shelby, suffers from anterograde amnesia, which means he is unable to form new long-term memories.
As a result, Leonard relies on a system of notes, tattoos, and polaroid photos to keep track of
information and remind himself of his goals.

As a user of ChatGPT, you might feel similar because you are interacting with an AI language model
that does not have the ability to remember previous conversations unless given context within the
current conversation. This can make it seem like the AI has memory issues, similar to Leonard's
condition in the movie.

To improve your experience with ChatGPT and make our interactions more cohesive, you can provide
context or a brief summary of our previous conversations. This will help me better understand your
questions and provide more relevant answers.
