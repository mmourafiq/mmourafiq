* Linguistic engine: A linguistic engine would be more specifically concerned with the generation,
processing, and interpretation of language. It might refer to a system or mechanism that focuses on
the rules, structures, and principles underlying human languages. In the context of artificial
intelligence and natural language processing, a linguistic engine could be a system that processes
and generates human language, enabling machines to understand and produce text or speech.

* Symbolic engine: A symbolic engine would focus more specifically on the generation, processing, and
interpretation of symbols. In this context, symbols are a subset of signs that represent or stand
for something else, often an abstract concept or idea. A symbolic engine might be used in fields
like artificial intelligence, where it could involve the manipulation and processing of symbolic
information, such as variables and logical expressions, to perform tasks or solve problems.

* Semiotic engine: As discussed earlier, a semiotic engine can be understood as a system or mechanism
that generates, processes, and interprets signs, symbols, and meanings. It encompasses a broad range
of signs and symbols, which can include words, images, sounds, gestures, and other communicative
elements. A semiotic engine deals with the study of signs and their meanings in various contexts,
including language, culture, and communication.

In summary, while all three terms refer to systems or mechanisms that deal with different aspects of
communication and meaning, a semiotic engine has a broader scope, encompassing all signs and
symbols, whereas a symbolic engine focuses on symbols specifically, and a linguistic engine focuses
on language in particular.
