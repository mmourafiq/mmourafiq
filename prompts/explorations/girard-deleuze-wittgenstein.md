## Girard's mimetic theory and Deleuze's desiring-production

Girard's mimetic theory posits that desire is imitative, and individuals desire objects or goals
because they see others desiring them. This leads to competition, rivalry, and, ultimately,
violence. Girard focused on how societies regulate and diffuse this conflict through scapegoating
mechanisms and religious rituals.

On the other hand, Deleuze, often in collaboration with Félix Guattari, developed the concept of "
desiring-production" in their book "Anti-Oedipus." They challenged the psychoanalytic notion of
desire as lack and argued that desire is a productive force that drives social and individual
development. Deleuze and Guattari's concept of the "rhizome" emphasizes the non-hierarchical,
interconnected nature of ideas, knowledge, and power structures.

Both philosophers considered the role of desire in shaping human behavior and society, but they
approached it from different perspectives. Girard focused on the imitative nature of desire, leading
to conflict, while Deleuze emphasized the productive and transformative aspects of desire.
Furthermore, Girard's work is grounded in anthropology, psychology, and theology, while Deleuze's
thought is rooted in metaphysics, epistemology, and political theory.

In summary, while René Girard and Gilles Deleuze share some common ground in their exploration of
desire, their theories and methodologies are notably different, and there is no direct relationship
between their works.

## Girard's mimetic theory and Wittgenstein's Rule-following

Language as a social practice: Wittgenstein's later work, particularly in the "Philosophical
Investigations" emphasizes the role of language as a social practice embedded in a community's "
forms of life." He argued that meaning arises from the use of language within specific social
contexts. This perspective resonated with Girard's idea of mimetic desire as a social phenomenon,
where desires are shaped by and transmitted through social interactions and cultural practices.

Rule-following and imitation: Wittgenstein also explored the concept of rule-following in human
behavior, suggesting that individuals learn to follow rules through imitation and participation in
shared practices. This idea aligns with Girard's notion of mimetic desire, where desires are
acquired through imitating others, leading to rivalries and conflicts.

While Girard did not explicitly build his theories upon Wittgenstein's philosophy, these
similarities reveal an indirect influence of Wittgenstein's ideas on Girard's understanding of how
language, social behavior, and desire are interconnected.
