### What I do

- Ideation and products building with experience in consumer, SaaS, and B2B. I know how to turn business requirements and ideas into a clean & simple technology components.
- Currently thinking/working on a couple of ideas:
  - Content repurposing, i.e video <-> blogs <-> podcast <-> shorts/notes/tweets <-> ...
  - Functional graphs on compute and cognitive layers.
  - Designing without being a designer.
  - UX for AI apps.
  - No-code abstractions for the creator economy.
  - Semiotics.
  - Thinking frameworks.
  - Copilot for growth.
  - Copilot for insights discovery.
  - Abstraction/Automation of repetitive work.
  - Tools for reporting, data-science, and analytics.
  - MLOps, LLMOps, FMOps, DataOps ...
- I bootstrapped and grew an open-core MLOps product:
  - I built the open-source technology: **14M+** downloads of SDKs, **25M+** downloads of Docker tools, and **4.2k+** Github stars in the OSS repos.
  - I wrote the initial blog posts, release notes, annoucements content, marketing site & copy, and the technical documentation.
  - I grew a community of data-scientists and machine learning engineers to **1.5k+** members.
  - I started with a support monetization strategy and eventually built a commercial offering around the OSS platform and closed the first sales.
  - I provided the initial support for both community users and paying customers.
- I worked in different roles that involves quantitative finance, data analytics, data-science collaboration & reporting, software engineering, deep learning, infrastructure, distributed systems, data validation, ML scheduling & orchestration, ML tracking, programmatic marketing, recommendation systems, team leading â€¦ at [EIB](https://www.eib.org/en/index.htm), [BNP Paribas](https://group.bnpparibas/en/), [Seerene](https://www.seerene.com/), [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/), [Dubsmash(acq. Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/). I also have a long list of projects that I started and spent a significant amount of time on: Plangr, Deedel, Ilage, Open-rating for CDOs, Harvest Analytics.

### What I know

- I am a very experienced engineer with focus on machine learning, data analytics and web development.
- I use a lot of Python. [Django, Starlette, Pandas, Tensorflow, Numpy, Scipy, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, IPython, ...]
- I am very experienced with Golang.
- I have strong understanding of Kubernetes and built custom operators. (I built one of the first machine learning operators & controllers for distributed training on Kubernetes)
- I built data pipelines using Spark, Dask, BigQuery, and other data processing systems.
- I built several analytics and intelligent internal tools in my previous jobs to empower non-technical users to derive business insights from the company's data. (As a weekend hackathon in a previous job, I replaced an expensive analytics tool with an internal dashboard to allow PMs, non-tech teams, and other engineers to quickly build performance dashboards and calculate kpis, metrics, usage, funnels, retention graphs, a/b test xps, â€¦, based on billions of events per day)
- I am certified in Postgresql. (As a fun project I built a native Postgres extension to perform options pricing - greeks using SQL)
- I am very knowledgeable about the current MLOps landscape and have very good understanding of the OSS tools to solve specific problems.
- I have strong knowledge and understanding of cloud platforms, and built cloud-native abstractions for AWS, GCP, Azure, â€¦
- I use Javascript/Typescript for frontend development with React, a bit of Vue, and in the past Angular.
- In the past I built a custom graphing and interactive charts library with D3.js, now I prefer integrating new products with Plotly, Bokeh, or Vega for most basic use-cases.
- In the past I worked with C++(STL, Boost, LAPACK), Matlab, Excel(vba, DLLs), and briefly with Cobol/Pacbase.

### Places where I hang out

- HN
- Github
- Twitter

### Get In Touch

- I post articles on my Blog from time to time about programming, math, finance, philosophyâ€¦ I am not a native english speaker, so feel free to correct me!
- Feel free to reach out about a project, a coding question, or anything else that's on your mind. Also If you have any trouble with something I posted, I'd be happy to help!
