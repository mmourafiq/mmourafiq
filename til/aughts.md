## Aughts

The term "aughts" refers to the first decade of a century, specifically the 2000s. It is used as a
colloquial way to refer to the years from 2000 to 2009. The term comes from the word "aught," which
means "anything" or "all" and is often used to refer to zero or the number 0. In this context, "
aughts" is a shortened form of "naughts," meaning "zeros" or "2000s."
