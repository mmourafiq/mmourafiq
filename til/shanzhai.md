## Shanzhai

Refers to imitation and trademark infringing brands and goods, particularly electronics in China.

Literally "mountain village" or "mountain stronghold", the term refers to the mountain stockades of
regional warlords or bandits, far away from official control.

"Shanzhai" can also be stretched to refer to people who are lookalikes, low-quality or improved
goods, as well as things done in parody.
