Wavy walls may require fewer bricks than straight walls due to an architectural principle known as
the "Catenary Curve." This principle, often used in architecture and engineering, allows structures
to bear more weight using less material.

A catenary curve describes the shape that an idealized hanging chain or cable assumes under its own
weight when supported only at its ends. This shape is the result of the balance between the
gravitational force that pulls the chain downward and the tension force along the chain. The
structure stands solely by virtue of its shape, and no additional supports or connectors are needed.

Wavy walls mimic the principles of a catenary curve. When you make a wall wavy, you are effectively
creating a series of arches. Arches are an incredibly strong architectural structure, able to
distribute weight efficiently down into the ground. These arch-like structures in a wavy wall
provide additional stability without the need for as much material.

Therefore, in a wavy wall, bricks are used more efficiently and provide more stability than they
would in a straight wall, potentially resulting in fewer bricks needed. That said, this approach may
involve more complex construction methods and possibly more time. These factors, alongside others
like aesthetics and functionality, would need to be considered.
