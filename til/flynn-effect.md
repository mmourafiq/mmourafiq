## Flynn effect

The Flynn effect is a theory in the field of intelligence research that suggests that average IQ
scores have been increasing at a steady rate across the world over the course of the 20th and early
21st centuries. This trend was first observed and subsequently studied by psychologist James R.
Flynn.

This phenomenon is generally thought to reflect societal changes rather than biological ones.
Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Flynn effect, including improvements in
nutrition, changes in education and child-rearing practices, reduction in exposure to harmful
environmental factors (like lead), and the increasing complexity of the modern world.

However, the Flynn effect appears to be reversing in some countries, where IQ scores have been seen
to decline in recent years. This counter-trend is often referred to as the "reverse Flynn effect,"
but as of my last update in September 2021, the causes behind this reversal are still not fully
understood.
