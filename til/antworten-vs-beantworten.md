## What is the Difference – “antworten vs. beantworten”

Let’s take a quick look at English first.

- I’ll answer the question.
- I’ll answer you.

Those sentences look like they have the same structure, but from a German perspective, they do not. Because only the second one can be translated with **antworten**.

- Ich beantworte dir die Frage.
- Ich antworte dir.
