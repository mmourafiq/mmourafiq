[Polyaxon](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon)â€™s mission is to make deep learning simple and accessible to enterprises.

Polyaxon, a platform for building, training, and monitoring large scale deep learning applications.

Polyaxon deploys into any data center, cloud provider, or can be hosted and managed by Polyaxon, and it supports all the major deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, MXNet, Caffe, Torch, etc.

Polyaxon makes it faster, easier, and more efficient to develop deep learning applications by managing workloads with smart container and node management. And it turns GPU servers into shared, self-service resources for your team or organization.
