When reading The Medici Effect, by Frans Johansson I was impressed by this one simple yet profound
insight about innovation: **In the intersection of different fields, disciplines and cultures,
there’s an abundance of extraordinary new ideas to be explored.**

An invitation to get more encyclopaedic in order to get more innovative. The more diversified ideas
we are exposed to, the better chances are to give birth to some brand new innovations. The book
makes a case for learning broadly and the importance of keeping a curious attitude. This comes as an
inspiring invitation to explore other areas than our own and as a reminder to always pursue our
‘side’ interests.

No doubt any one has some great and innovative ideas, but few are who go one step forward to execute
this ideas. One thing that I liked about this book is the fact that this book not only focus on the
dynamics of generating ideas, but goes to discuss how to implement them.

* Intersectional ideas:

Getting open to new fields could change your world, not only you will be able to meet some new
interesting people, but also you will have the possibility the get surprised by the fascinating
approaches this people apply to resolve problems they face. The exploration of new ideas could have
a big impact on how you analyse problems related to your background.

* Medici effect:

Make barriers fall, by associating ideas and finding key associations between different concepts.
This will affect the way you learn and the way you see your environment.

find combination between intersectional ideas, diversify your occupations by learning different
cultures, frequenting different groups of people.

Go hunting ideas wherever you feel less comfortable, the chances of discovering new concepts are
higher than sticking with things we are getting used to.

* Execution:

Make your concepts real, start by your failures: "how did the occur ?", "did I approach them from
the right angle ?", "should I reconsider resolving by an other way?"

Break with your currents networks, and go for new ones.

Take risks and master fear.

Now you are more prepared to change the world.
